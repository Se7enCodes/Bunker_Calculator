Tired of guessing and calculating how many classes more you can leave in a particular subject??? 
Worry no more, just track which class you are missing, and you are done with your work.

Run this program, and get to know how many in total, classes you can skip, and still pass the 75% attendance criteria easily.
This program asks you for your branch, and your group number in lab sessions, and will tell you how many classes for a specific subject/course you have in this sem, and how many in total you can skip.

So 

NO MORE MORNING HURRIES,

NO MORE GUESS-WORK, and

NO MORE ATTENDANCE STRESS
